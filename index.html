            <p align="justify">
              I am a graduate of Computer Science from the National Open
              University of Nigeria in 2017, I've been opportuned to work in
              various capacities for different organizations over the course of
              8+ years now. The experience I've garnered in the industry border
              majorly on IT Administration and IT Project Management.
            </p>

            <p align="justify">
              I have always been interested in software development for the
              potential growth it can avail any individual in the present world
              and its wonderful economic applications. In order to learn this, I
              have tried teaching myself through online web content, taking paid
              courses and other meaningful avenues but the challenge of
              overcoming one topic or the other persisted, especially when it
              came to JavaScript. I had decided to drive my career focus towards
              other sections of computer science but this course came up last
              minute and I decided not to forgo my efforts and give up on
              coding. I am happily married with two wonderful children.
